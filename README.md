My Alfred Workflows
===================

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 workflows and extension.

**iOS Simulator Launcher**
This workflow is for running the iOS Simulator and its devices from the Xcode Application.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|iossimulator|This will run the iOS simulator regardless of the last device used.|
|ioslaunch \<devicename\>|This will launch an iOS device based on the argument specified.|
|iosopenurl \<url\>|This will open the URL specified in the iOS Simulator's currently booted device.|
